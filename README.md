EasyDate is a jQuery plugin to format dates into a human-readable form and continuously update them to stay accurate while the user remains on the page. The plugin will parse a RFC 1123 valid timestamp from a DOM element's title attribute or innerHTML property and format it into a human-readable form (e.g., "2 weeks ago").
